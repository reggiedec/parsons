		<p> Body Copy: Bonjour! I’m Robin, I’m a French designer based in Portugal. I'm available for full-time roles, freelance projects, and design advising.
			I design digital products and websites for startups, brands, and entrepreneurs with cool projects.
			I ask a lot of questions to understand the problems my clients want to solve and the goals they want to achieve. I then create high-fidelity wireframes that aim to address those goals. Those wireframes get turned into visual interfaces, sometimes with subtle motion effects, to be prototyped and tested with real people.
